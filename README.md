#
This is my personal CV.

This CV is dynamically created using [rendercv](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) and the yaml file available [here](https://github.com/syamk/cv/blob/main/syamk_CV.yaml). The custom template used to override style and latex code can be found under the syamktheme folder. Motive of using rendercv is flexibility with content separation and quick render between different file formats. 


The render is run using the rendercv binary locally. 'lualatex' is required for this process. Use '--use-local-latex-command lualatex'
