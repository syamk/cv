    Summary:
      - I am a seasoned techno-functional engineering leader with nearly two decades of stable experience in developing and maintaining complex, distributed, scalable, and highly available software systems. My startup experiences have made me a self-driven and results-oriented leader with exceptional people management skills and a strong entrepreneurial spirit. My work experience spans web, mobile, highly scalable SaaS, social media platforms, cloud, DevOps, analytics, and security. I am passionate about "customer delight," a lesson I carry from a brief stint as a sales executive during college.
      - As a leader at JFrog, I was instrumental in founding and leading the Installers team, a role that demanded expertise in facilitating strong, collaborative connections both inside the company and with external stakeholders. Over the years, I have realized it is okay not to be the technical authority in the room but rather an "influencer" of ideas. I strongly believe in servant leadership.
      - For the past 15 years, I have developed a deep proficiency in cloud technologies and DevOps practices. I have previously worked as a full-stack engineer, proficient in Go, JavaScript, web UI, PHP, Python, Kubernetes, and related technologies, before transitioning into an engineering manager role. Recently, I have developed a scholarly interest in machine learning. As a lifelong learner and problem solver, I spend my weekends studying AI/ML and contributing to open-source ML communities.
